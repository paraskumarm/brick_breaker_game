This is the HTML code for a webpage that includes a "score" and "lives" section, a "container" div, and a link to a JavaScript file called "index.js". The CSS file "style.css" is also linked to the HTML file. The JavaScript file is likely where the interactivity and dynamic functionality of the webpage is defined and implemented.
